# IceWaves

​This is a game based on the topic of winter

Waves of icy snowmen but can you defeat them all?

Controls:

WASD - To move

R - Restore mana

Left Click - Attack

This game was made for Hackclub Siege Week 13 for the theme of Winter and I personally enjoyed making this one because of the implementation of enemy AI the first time around, i also really enjoyed learning how to use arrays to create waves, the whole game is super customizable.
